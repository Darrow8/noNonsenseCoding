# No Nonsense Coding
A repository to teach unfamiliar languages to people familiar with code fast


# What is This?

This repo is designed to teach those who can already code in a seperate/multiple seperate languages a new language fast. Most tutorials online go on and on about why learning the given language is beneficial, setting up the IDE and Downloading the environment. Furthermore, they usually slowly explain concepts that are already obvious to those who have been coding for a while. This makes it hard for more advanced coders to utilize these tutorials. No Nonsense Coding removes that friction by creating tutorials on languages that are quick and that don't drone on about simple concepts. I hope this repo can help you!

# Where is the Channel?

For these tutorials, I will be posting a video along (ideally 5-10 min) on the given language as well as a file of the code used.
